- This template was modified from this template: https://github.com/kytx42/Azure/tree/master/Azure-2FW-Public-LB
- This template supports the deployment of a Palo Alto Networks Firewall in an Availability Zone.  It supports the following features:
- The firewall deploys with 3 interfaces.  1 MGMT and 2 data plane. 
- A Standard SKU public IP address is attached to the MGMT interface.
- A Default NSG is applied to the MGMT interface.
- Static private IP addresses are assigned to the interfaces based on the input in the starting ip address fields.
